#Variable declaration and assignment
a = 5
#variable manipulation
a = 6

#variable 'a' now has the value of 6
print(a)

#operators

#addition
a = a + 4
a += 4

#subtraction
a = a - 4
a -= 4

#multiplication
a = a*2
a *= 2

#division
a = a/2
a /= 2

#strings
b = "hello world"

#strings can be treated as a list of characters (substrings)
# b[0] = 'h'
#Strings can also be divided into subcategories
#USEFUL STRING OPERATION
#b[1:] -> returns the string except the first letter -> 'ello world'
# '/n' == new line
